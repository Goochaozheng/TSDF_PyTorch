# PyTroch Implemented TSDF

A TSDF fusion framework implemented using Python & PyTorch.   
- Better integration with PyTorch based neural network.    
- Utilizing the GPU & CPU capability of torch tensor.  
- Adding visualization based on Open3D.  

The TSDF part is Based on [3DMatch Toolbox](https://github.com/andyzeng/3dmatch-toolbox)
